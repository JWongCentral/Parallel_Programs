#parallelized consecutive prime numbers
  A consecutie prime number are any prime numbers excluding 1 and 2 where the minimum distance between the prime numbers is 2.
  Such as 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19, etc.
  To increase efficiency I used the sieve of eratosthenes to find all the prime numbers from 1 to N. Then we go through it once more to calculate the consecutive prime numbers.
