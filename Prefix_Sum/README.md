#Prefix sum

  This is a common parallelization problem that involves a problem where we must add consecutively or perform an action consecutively.
  The solution is to divide the array in N-sized chunks. Then perform addition on each chunk down to one number (called prefix sum.
  Then we add up the numbers together to get the total/sum of all the numbers. This is a problem most programmers would face in one way or 
  another where the number is dependent on the preceeding/proceeding value where we must find a way to reduce the problem. A common utilization of this is GPU 
  calculations on rendering in graphics.
